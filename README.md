# Skiller Whale Solid Principles in JavaScript Exercises

This repo contains the accompanying exercises for all of the Skiller Whale
training sessions for solid principles in JavaScript.

To use this you'll need to be part of a live Skiller Whale training session, and
have installed Docker for your computer.

Then:

* from the training session, note down the _Your ID_ field in the top-right;
* copy this into the file called `attendance_id`;
* run `docker-compose up` in one window;
* run `docker-compose run javascript` in another window;
* open your code editor in the `exercises` folder.

You should see the words "Sync Active" in the top right of your training session.
If not, please ask the trainer for help.

After this any changes you make to your exercises will be sent to the trainer
during the session.
